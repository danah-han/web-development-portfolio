My favorite web development projects that I've worked on

## Static home page inspired by the New Yorker magazine
*[View Here](https://dartmouth-cs52-19s.github.io/lab1-landingpage-danah-han/?fbclid=IwAR3a-qiI2FUHUb4vgM-_PoFhBt8ezKYUDvz71kP1vMVD8gfAT-XAcIw9sII)*
The stories on the home page were inspired by people at school and what they were up to during spring term. Full screen recommended for the best viewing experience.

## Real-time collaborative Post-it notes app
*[View Here](http://danah-cs52-notes-app.surge.sh/)*
The app was built with React and a Firebase backend. The content is persistent, so if you close the window and reopen, your notes will be saved. It was also built to support real-time collaboration, so try opening two browser windows and playing around :)
